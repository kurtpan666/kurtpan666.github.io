> The code structure follows the modular design of the protocol, which involves combining an elastic polynomial commitment scheme and an elastic (holographic) PIOP. 
We deem each of the single components of the protocol (the streaming infrastructure, the commitment scheme,and the sub-protocols for sumcheck, tensor check, entry product, lookup protocol, etc.) to be independent interest for future space-efficient projects.


There is a long line of work on improving the **time complexity of SNARK provers**, both asymptotically and concretely; this has culminated in SNARKs with *linear-time provers*. See {cite}`2021/1043` and references therein.

However, these optimizations typically come at the expense of **space complexity**, which is typically *linear* in the computation size either due to the use of *FFTs* or *dynamic programming algorithms*.
